# Machine_Housing
All our code and workflow are in the 'Final Project.ipynd', the dataset is pulled directly from the
website, so you don't need to use the CSV that we included. Some of the cross-validation functions do
take some time, some maybe up to 5 min, but everything should finish running. As requested, we included 
the unaltered dataset 'housing_prices_raw.csv' as well as the dataset that we used to run all our 
models, 'housing_prices_cleaned_standardized.csv'.
