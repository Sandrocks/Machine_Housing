# Machine_Housing
All our code and workflow are in the 'Final Project.ipynd', the dataset is pulled directly from the
website, so you don't need to use the CSV that we included. Some of the cross-validation and permutation importannce functions do
take some time, some maybe up to 5 min, but everything should finish running. As requested, we included 
the unaltered dataset 'housing_prices_raw.csv' as well as the cleaned dataset that we used to run all our 
models, 'housing_prices_cleaned_standardized.csv'.

Click "run all" from the first line of the notebook in a google colab environemnt.
We finished all our code in google colab. Some modifications might be needed in the code related to package installation.
