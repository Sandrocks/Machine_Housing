# Machine_Housing
All our codes and workflow are in the 'Final Project.ipynb', the dataset is pulled directly from the
website, so you don't need to use the CSV that we included. Some of the cross-validation and permutation importannce functions do
take some time, some maybe up to 5 min, but everything should finish running. As requested, we included 
the unaltered dataset 'housing_prices_raw.csv' as well as the cleaned dataset that we used to run all our 
models, 'housing_prices_cleaned_standardized.csv'.

Click "run all" from the first line of the notebook in a Google Colab environemnt.
We completed all our code in Google Colab. Some modifications may be necessary in the codes related to package installation if this notebook is run in a local environment.
